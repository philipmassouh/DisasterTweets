Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets

NAIVE BAYES

    The libraries necessary to run the logistic regression code are RegEx and CSV there is no need to install them. Run by executing the command 'py naive_bayes.py'. The code will take a few seconds to run and a csv file called 'result1.csv' will be created in the directory. This project idea comes from kaggle so the test target column was not given rather this 'results1.csv' file must be uploaded to find the accuracy. The url to find the page is 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/submit'. Upload the csv file here to get an the same accuracy we found.


LOGISTIC REGRESSION

    The libraries necessary to run the logistic regression code are pandas, numpy, nltk, and sklearn. After installing the libraries, execute the command 'py logistic_regression.py'. The code will take a few seconds to run and a csv file called 'result2.csv' will be created in the directory. This project idea comes from kaggle so the test target column was not given rather this 'results2.csv' file must be uploaded to find the accuracy. The url to find the page is 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/submit'. Upload the csv file here to get an the same accuracy we found.
